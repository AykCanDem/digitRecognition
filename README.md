# Digit Recognition

A web application that uses convolutional neural network in back-end for digit recognition.

Notes:
Working anaconda environment for heroku : heroku_1
requirments.txt is a bit different than environment.yml since some of the dependencies are removed from requirements.txt to make it work on heroku.

Aptfile is needed to install some packages for opencv in heroku.
